North Star Advantage ROMs

The Advantage is an 8-bit all in one business computer contemporary with the original IBM PC, with a high quality keyboard, a 640x240 framebuffer, and 350KB disk drives.  There is some information about it online but limited information about its firmware.  I've disassembled and documented its boot ROM and have begun work on its network interface board firmware and the floppy-keyboard controller firmware.
